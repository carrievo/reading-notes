# 05: HTML Images, CSS Color & Text

### Images:
- Having images on your website can make your site look more attractive and engaging.
- It is good practice to create a separate folder for just your images to keep your site organized.
- You can include image(s) on your HTML and use CSS to align image(s) to desired position, size and to indicate how you want other things to flow around your image(s).
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs and flat illustrations/logos are best saved as GIFs.

### Colors:
- Every color is created by mixing red, green, and blue. There are a lot of useful CSS color tools availabel online to help you with color schemes.
  - [Here is a really good resource from Adobe!](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
- When picking out a colorfor yoru foreground/background, make sure there's enough contrast so that the text is legible.
- There are 3 ways to specify colors:
  1. RGB values
  2. Hex codes
  3. Color names
- CSS3 has an extra value for RGB to indicate opacity called RGBA and allows you to specify colors as HSL values with optional opacity value called HSLA (Duckett 254-256).

### Text:
- You can control the choice of font, size, weight, style, spacing.
- Like images, you can align the text to the desired position of your page and decide how the text should flow.

### "JPEG vs PNG vs GIF â€” which image format to use and when?" Written by Rahul Nanwani.
[In this article,](https://blog.imagekit.io/jpeg-vs-png-vs-gif-which-image-format-to-use-and-when-c8913ae3e01d) the author gives us lots of useful images tips!
- "Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations."

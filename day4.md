# Day 4: Structure web pages with HTML

### Here are the few things I learned about for building my HTML site

**Wireframe & design**: Before starting an HTML site, you should create an outline/mockup drawing of how you want your site to look and the placements of everything. This should be simple and clear. Think of who your audiance is and perhaps use personas so you could build around those personas. Once you have your design, you can then start your site!

**HTML Basics**: HTML is the sites skeleton and structure and is black and white.
- For every opening, there must be a closing. 


**CSS**: CSS is the interior designer and presentation. 
- This is what adds color, text sizes, pictures, columns, etc. to your site.

**JavaScript**: This is known as the "bells and whistles." You can use JavaScript to move pictures, create pop-ups, add prompts, movable items, etc. The coolest thing about JS is this can be used on the front and back end!

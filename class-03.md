# 03: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

### The 3 types of HTML Lists:
- **Ordered list**: Use numbers.
- **Unordered lists**: Use bullets.
- **Definition lists**: To define terms.

### What are arrays?
- Array is an ordered list of values and is best used when you are working with a list or set of values that are related to each other (Duckett 70).
  - For example: you can have an array that stores values like numbers, booleans, and strings.

### Boxes:
- CSS is used to create the way the boxes (HTML elements) are organized on the screen. 
  - you can control the dimensions of the boxes by changing the margins, padding, borders and properties.

### Switch Statements:
- Switch statement checks only for equality whereas if-else states check for equality and logical expression.
- This option will continue to run if none of the cases match.
- If the statement is found, the statement stops the rest of the run.
- This can be more efficient then useing 'if' statements.

### Terms in JS to know..
- Type Coercion: Convert datatypes behind the scenes to complete an operation.
- Weak typing: JS uses this, meaning data type for a value can change.
- Strong typing: Other languages require that you specify what data type each variable can be.
- Falsy: Treated as if they are false.
- Truthy: Values treated as if they are true.
- Unary operator: Returns a result with just one operand.

### loops:
- It's a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 
- The condition has to be true and had to be met and will keep running until the condition is met.
- Cool fact - the *for* loop syntax is the same as how you write loops for *any* other language!

**To set a loop**
1. You must declare the variable
2. Set the condition
3. Set what happens to the variable after each iteration

### There are 3 types of loops
1. While loops
2. For loops
3. Do while

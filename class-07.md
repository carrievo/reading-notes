# Read: 07 - HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions

### Tables:
- A table represents information in a grid format and allows us to understand and reference data by referencing information on two axes.
  - Basic table structure: 
    - <\table> : Which creates the table.
    - <\tr> : Indicating the start of each row.
    - <\td> : Each cell of a table is represented.
    - <\th> : Represent the heading for either a column or a row.
      - <\th> scope="row"> Tickets sold<\th>
    - You can span columns - 
      - <\td colspan="2"> : to span over 2 columns for example.
    - You can also span rows - 
      - <\td rowspan="3"> : to span over 3 rows from top to bottom.
- Long tables, which include:
    - <\thead> : the headings of the table
    - <\tbody> : the body should sit inside this element.
    - <\tfoot> : the footer sits inside this element.

- With the help of **CSS**, you can manipulate the width, spacing, border and background of the table/columns/rows.

### Other things to note:
  - The sizing of the page matters!**
  - (Duckett 379) Mentioned that because screen sizes and display resolutions vary in side, designers try to create pages around *960-1000* pixels wide.
  - Fxed width layouts: where the size and positions of the elements are more controlled. 
  - Liquid layouts: pages expand to fill the entire browser with no spaces around the page on a large screen.
  - Grids: on a page can help create structure on the webpage so designers can more easily position and easily organize the page layout. 
  - You can include multiple CSS files in one page. Helps when there are multiple people working on the same project.

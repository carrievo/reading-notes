### Functions:
- A JS function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task, basically the **action**.
- When using a *function*, it is followed by a *name*, then *parenthesis*. Make sure the function is placed inside *curly brackets*.
- For the function to work, you must create a *return*.

### Operators:

# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Transforms
- Transform property comes in two different settings:
  1. Two-dimensional
      - Can alter elements on the horizontal and verticle axes.
  2. Three-dimensional
      - Can alter elements on teh z-axis, giving us control of depths as well as length and width.
  
## Transitions & Animation
- Transition: you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs.
  - Hover over, focused on, active, or targeted.
  - The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

# Day 1: Introductory HTML and JavaScript

### What is HTML?
- HTML stands for *HyperText Markup Language*
- HTML pages are text documents, basically a site that is black and white. Also known as the web structure or skeleton.
- Tags must be used and come in pairs so it must have a 'start' tag and 'end' tag.
- Opening tags carry attributes, in which require a name and value.
- Before you build, **know who your audience is** and structure a wireframe or sitemap, this is a very useful tool to start with! 

### Below are a few important markups to know:
- DOCTYPES = let's you know which version of HTML you're using
- </!-- and --> = To add comments for personal use
- id and class attributes = identifies particular elements
- div and span elements = allows you to group block-level and inline elements together
- iframes = is an inline frame, this element is used to insert content from another source onto your webpage.
- meta = provides information about the webpage within the document

### What is CSS?
- CSS is used to enhance your HTML structure. This is known as the "interior designer" because it adds presentation to your site, like color, text sizes, pictures, columns, etc.


### What is JavaScript?
- Once you combine JS with HTML, this allows you to make yoru webpage more interactive. It is known as the "bells and whistles." You can use JavaScript to move pictures, create pop-ups, add prompts, movable items, etc.

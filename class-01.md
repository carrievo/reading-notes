# Day 1: Introductory HTML and JavaScript

### What is HTML?
- HTML stands for *HyperText Markup Language*
- HTML pages are text documents, basically a site that is black and white. Also known as the web structure or skeleton.
- Tags must be used and come in pairs so it must have a 'start' tag and 'end' tag.
- Opening tags carry attributes, in which require a name and value.
- Before you build, know who your audience is and structure a wireframe. 

### Below are a few important markups to know:
- DOCTYPES = let's you know which version of HTML you're using
- </!-- and --> = To add comments for personal use
- id and class attributes = identifies particular elements
- div and span elements = allows you to group block-level and inline elements together

# 02: Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

### Text:
- When you create a web page, you must use tags, which are known as markup.
- There are 2 markups I learned in our reading from Duckett, J. (2011).
1. **Structural Markup:** Element that describes both headings and paragraphs.
2. **Semantic Markup:** Provides extra information or meaning of each element through proper selection. 

#### Listed below are some important tags for setting up an HTML site!
- HTML = You always want to start with this tag because it starts the HTML document.
- !DOCTYPE HTML = Will tell the computer you're using HTML5
- HTML lang="en" = Will make sure the text is in English.
- head = Sets up the header of the page that isn't displayed (displayed on tab).
- body = This is the visible part of the site.
- title = This is where you put the name of the document in the title bar.
- P = This is used for a paragraph. Each time you use this tag, your paragraph will show on a new line.
- footer = footnote of the page, which should be placed within the body.
  <u>*Reminder to always open and close the tag!*</u>

### Intro to CSS:
- Is used to make your page "pretty," this is what gives your site presentation.
- This works by associating rules with HTML elements and contains 2 parts, you need a *selector* and a *declaration*. 
- CSS element properties affect how elements are displayed abd contain both a *property* and a *value*.

### Basic JavaScript Instructions
- A script is a series of instructions and each instruction or step is called a **statement**. 
- JS is case sensitive
- Each statement should start on a new line and can be organized in code blocks, { }.
- Comments are helpful! 
  - Multi-line comments: /* Start and end with your comments within these characters */
  - Single-line comment: // by using two forward slashes.

### Data Types:
- strings
  - a sequence of characters that we use to represent text.. can be letters/numbers/symbols.
- booleans
  - true or false
- numbers
  - can be numbers, decimals and negative numbers.

### Decisions & Loops:
- Start with a flowchat, this can really help you figure out how you want your line to run.
- **Conditional Statements** allow your code to make decisions on what to do next. 
- **Comparison Operators** are used to compare two operands.
- **Logical Operators** allows you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- **if...else** statements allow you to run true and false statements. 

**To set a loop**
  1. You must declare the variable
  2. Set the condition
  3. Set what happens to the variable after each iteration

**There are 3 types of loops**
  1. While loops
  2. For loops
  3. Do while

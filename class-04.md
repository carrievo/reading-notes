# 04: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### Links:
- This is a feature that allows you to move from one webpage to another. This includes moving from links within the same website, move to a completely new website, or when you click on the link, it could open up a new browser window or start up a new email.
- Links are created using the < a > element.
  - This link code usually looks like this: < a href="LINK GOES HERE">04 Notes<\a>
- If you have multiple links on your website, it would be a good idea to create **directory structure**. 
  - You can create folders on your main website page and place pages for each of the different sections.
- You can also link to a specific part of your main website page.
 - for example, if your're at the bottom of the webpage and want to jump back to the top: < p>< a href = "#top>Top< /a>< /p>


### Layouts of CSS:
- You can control the position of elements.
  - You can create a normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning, fixed positioning, and floating positioning.
- You can float the elements to have it placed side by side.
- Create multi-column layouts with floats.
- The sizing of the page matters!
  - (Duckett 379) Mentioned that because screen sizes and display resolutions vary in side, designers try to create pages around *960-1000* pixels wide.
- **Fxed width** layouts: where the size and positions of the elements are more controlled. 
- **Liquid** layouts: pages expand to fill the entire browser with no spaces around the page on a large screen.
- Using **grids** on a page can help create structure on the webpage so designers can more easily position items on the page.

### Functions:
- A function is the **action**.
- This allows you to write code in larger, more logical chunks and focuses on what X does, rather than how X does it.
- For it to qualify as a function, there is an input and return output with a relationship, you then must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

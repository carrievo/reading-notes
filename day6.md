# Day 6: Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language, known as the "bells and whistles." You can use JavaScript to move pictures, create pop-ups, add prompts, movable items, etc.
- **Front-end**: client side.
- **Back-end**: Server side
- JS is easier to use to build out a full stack application because it uses the same language for two different projects, from front to end. *ex: you can use JS with Python, or JS with any other language.*

**To insert JavaScript**: You should create a .js file in your VS code and add <p><script src="script.js"> </script></p> to the HTML file.

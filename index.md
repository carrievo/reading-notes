## Hi, my name is Carrie :)
[Link to my Grithub portfolio](https://carrievo.github.io/reading-notes/)

My background is data source and mortgage. I'm working on a MacOS Big Sur Version 11.4. When I grow up I want to become a Software Developer, so I'm super excited to start this coding journey and to transition into a new career! 

### What is this?
This is my reading notes repository.

### Growth Mindset to me is..
1.  Being able to use others as your inspiration and learning from them.
1.  Having the desire to learn and be motivated to succeed. 
1.  Being okay with failing and admitting your struggles, it gives you the opportunity to learn from it.
1.  Be able to accepting feedback/critisism and making it a positive thing so that you could get better.

##### Reminder to self: To grow is to keep learning, stay positive, and always keep an open mind.

#Code 201

#### Hi, my name is Carrie :)
I am from Minnesota but have been living in Southern California for about 5 years now with my boyfriend and our two furbabies, Apple and Berry. I have been working at Zillow for about 3 years with a background in data source and mortgage. I'm looking to pursue a career in Software Developement and I'm super excited to start this coding journey!

### Growth Mindset to me is..
1.  Being able to use others as your inspiration and learning from them.
1.  Having the desire to learn and be motivated to succeed. 
1.  Being okay with failing and admitting your struggles, it gives you the opportunity to learn from it.
1.  Be able to accepting feedback/critisism and making it a positive thing so that you could get better.

##### Reminder to self: In order to grow, you must keep learning, stay positive, and always keep an open mind.

## Hi, my name is Carrie :)
[Link to my Grithub portfolio](https://carrievo.github.io/reading-notes/)

My background is in data source and mortgage and I've been with Zillow for over 3 years. I am from Minnesota, but now live in Southern California with my boyfriend and our two furbabies, Apple & Berry. When I grow up I want to become a Software Developer, so I'm super excited to start this coding journey and to transition into a new career!

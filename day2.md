### Text Editors

_What_ is it & _why_ is it important?
Text editors are tools that allow you to edit, write and create. This could be used for a number of tasks, like drafting a document or editing a webpage to developing a new program. 

Listed below are the different kinds of editors:
1. "Basic" Text editor: Used for writing and modifying text/code.
2. Coding specific text editor: There are many programs out there that are fairly similar with the same goal in mind. It's designed to simplify source code.
3. IDE: Stands for Integrated Developmental Environment. This does what a text editor does but has more use, like debugging, verison control, etc.

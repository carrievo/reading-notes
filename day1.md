# Day 1: Learning Markdown

_Listed below are some of the things I learned in from class 1:_

#### What is markdown?
- Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. 
- This is a great skill to have because it makes coding simpler and quicker, plus it looks great on your resume!

#### What is Mindset?
- Mindset is how you percieve yourself. If you have a fixed mindset, you may believe that "I can't do this", whereas if you have a growth mindset, you welcome the challenge.


#### Growth mindset is good! 
1.  Use others as your inspiration and learning from them.
1.  Have the desire to learn and be motivated to succeed. 
1.  Failing is okay, admit your struggles, it gives you the opportunity to learn from it.
1.  Accept feedback/critisism and make it a positive thing so that you could grow from it.


**Important Takeaways**
1. Stacked Learning is the best way to retain new and previously taught material.
1. Growth mindset > fixed mindset = Success!
1. Markdown is a great skill to have, looks great on your resume, and makes code life easier.

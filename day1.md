# Day 1: Learning Markdown

_Listed below are some of the things I learned from class 1:_

#### What is markdown?
- Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. 
- When you create a markdown-formatted file, you're adding syntax to the text to indicate how you want your words or phrases to look. 
For example: I can change the way words look, **like this!**.
- This is a great skill to have because it makes coding simpler and quicker, plus it looks great on your resume!

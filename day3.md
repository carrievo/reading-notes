# Day 3: Revisions and the Cloud
### What I learned in day 3 of class..
- We set up our text editor and cloned down our 'reading notes' to our local computer through the terminal. The terminal connects us to VS Code and VS Code is where we will be doing all our future work. 
- This exercise also taught me that once you have everything linked, you **must** only make changes/updates in VS Code, save your changes, make a note, and push the code to GitHub. You should **never** make changes in GitHub and try to pull it down, it makes the process so much more complicated.

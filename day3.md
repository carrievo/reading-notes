# Day 3: Revisions and the Cloud
### What I learned in day 3 of class..
- We set up our text editor and cloned down our 'reading notes' to our local computer through the terminal. The terminal connects us to VS Code and VS Code is where we will be doing all our future work. 
- This exercise also taught me that once you have everything linked, you **must** only make changes/updates in VS Code, save your changes, make a note, and push the code to GitHub. You should **never** make changes in GitHub and try to pull it down, it makes the process so much more complicated.

### what is GIT?
It's a version control system, when ever you change the file, it will keep all the versions of the files
- lets multiple devs work on same code
- a history of changes to your files
- the ability to view, apply and remove those changes
- keep all your project files in one repository.
- makes collaboration possible

**Commits**: "save as" - when you commit a file, GIT keeps track of what the file looked like and saves another version of the file. takes snapshots of your code at points in time/keeps a history.
- file A: you make some changes, you commit it, saves as
- file B, you commit it, saves file C. 
	- this way you can see what changes you've made and see exactly what codes you've used.
